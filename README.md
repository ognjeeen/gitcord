For all the necessary information, visit the [gitcord](https://gitcord-sepia.vercel.app/) application. </br>
I have provided absolutely everything you need to use this application and also I explained how potentially you can implement this project in your own application.
If you want to use this application, please read 'Notes! Important!' section. </br>

In the future, if I make any major updates to the project, I'll leave a message here as well as on gitcord.
